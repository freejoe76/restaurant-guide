## Usage

### How to update a subway route
1. Edit data/mta.geojson and add / update the route for the desired line.
2. If you have stations to add / remove / change location, edit the data/subway_geo.geojson file. Each line in it corresponds with a station, and records the station name and lat/long.
3. If you're just adding or removing stations, also update the data/stops.json file.
